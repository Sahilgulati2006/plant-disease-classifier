# Plant Disease Image Classification with CNN

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify plant diseases from leaf images. The model is deployed using Streamlit for an interactive and user-friendly interface.

## Features

- **Interactive App**: Upload leaf images and get instant disease classification results.
- **Deep Learning Model**: Built using CNN for high accuracy.
- **Streamlit Deployment**: Simplifies usage with a web-based interface.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**  
- **TensorFlow/Keras**  
- **Streamlit**  
- **OpenCV, Matplotlib, NumPy**
